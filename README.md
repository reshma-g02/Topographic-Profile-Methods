# Topographic-Profile-Methods
This study evaluates four different methods for measuring elevation at UNH’s Foss Farm: hand leveling with a Brunton compass, GPS waypoints, LiDAR data, and Google Earth profiles. By comparing the accuracy and precision of each technique, the research identifies which tools best capture subtle changes in topography and surficial geology.
